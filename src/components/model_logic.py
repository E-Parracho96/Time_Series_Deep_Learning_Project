    """This is a dynamic function. The logic here is having a rolling window of 14 days for each record
       which is already resampled hourly.
       First it will loop for each production_PV record, and the ideia is trying to predict what will be
       the production_PV value in the next day based on the last 14 records at each timestamp.
       
       Example: If I want to predict what will be the production_PV value at 1PM in 15 May, this prediction
                will be based on the last 14 records (between 1 and 14 May) at 1PM, then want to predict
                what will be the value at 2PM, this prediction will be based on the values at 2PM between
                1 and 14 May, ... , skipping to the next day, and so on.
       
       Here the night periods are filtered because otherwise the model would have a big bias, predicting that 
       at night the production would be 0, which is obvious, changing the real performance of the model.
       If we are predicting the production_PV values we only want the diurn part of the dataset, thatÂ´s why,
       the sun elevation is filtered at 5 degrees and the production_PV values at 0.0001.
